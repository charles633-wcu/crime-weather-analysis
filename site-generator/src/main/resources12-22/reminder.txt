Crime & Weather Analytics
Statistical Dashboard – Best Practices Reminder
==============================================

PRIMARY GOAL
------------
Demonstrate statistical reasoning and data literacy, not just visualization.
The dashboard should communicate patterns honestly, without overstating conclusions.


DEFAULT VISUALIZATION
---------------------
Use AGGREGATED or SMOOTHED views by default.

• Binned temperature → average incidents is preferred
• Raw daily scatter plots are exploratory and should be secondary
• Default view should reduce noise and improve interpretability


SCATTER PLOT USAGE
------------------
Scatter plots are valid, but should be used carefully.

Use scatter plots to:
• Explore relationships
• Show correlation + regression
• Support analysis, not headlines

Always include:
• Regression line (if appropriate)
• Clear axis labels
• Acknowledgment of variability

Scatter should be TOGGLED, not default.


WHAT TO WRITE UNDER THE CHART
-----------------------------
Example language (keep it short and honest):

"Daily-level data is highly variable. Aggregated temperature bins are shown
by default to improve interpretability."

or

"A linear regression indicates a positive association between temperature
and incident frequency; correlation does not imply causation."


REGRESSION & CORRELATION
------------------------
Regression is allowed ONLY when:
• There is a scatter plot
• The relationship is described as ASSOCIATION
• No causal claims are made

Good:
• Pearson correlation coefficient (r)
• R² value
• Brief interpretation

Avoid:
• Causal language
• Overconfident conclusions


TIME-BASED VISUALS (USE SPARINGLY)
---------------------------------
Do NOT overlay temperature and incidents on the same time chart with dual axes.

Acceptable time-based charts:
• Rolling average of incidents only
• Incident counts per year
• Monthly averages (seasonality)

Temperature trends should be discussed in text if needed.


BINNING GUIDELINES
------------------
Temperature bins should:
• Be coarse (3–5 bins max)
• Cover meaningful ranges
• Be consistent across the dataset

Always use averages or medians within bins.


SEARCH / DRILL-DOWN
-------------------
Search-by-date is GOOD.

Purpose:
• Ground abstract statistics in concrete examples
• Allow verification of aggregated trends
• Improve transparency

Search output should include:
• Date
• Temperature
• Incident count
• Raw incident list (if available)


LIMITATIONS (HIGH VALUE)
-----------------------
Always acknowledge limitations.

Examples:
• Correlation does not imply causation
• Seasonality may confound results
• Reporting practices may vary by year
• External socioeconomic factors not included

This signals maturity and credibility.


WHAT TO AVOID
-------------
• Dual y-axis charts
• Claims of causation
• Overly complex models
• Machine learning for simple relationships
• Excessive UI controls
• Overfitting visuals to tell a story


FINAL CHECK
-----------
If a recruiter or reviewer asks:
"What insight does this chart provide?"

You should be able to answer in ONE sentence.


PHILOSOPHY
----------
Clarity > complexity
Honesty > impressiveness
Interpretability > aesthetics


PUT NUMBERS UNDER THE CHART SUMMARY
You only need 4–5 numbers total:

Correlation coefficient (r)

R²

Regression slope (β)

Mean incidents per day

Standard deviation (optional)
